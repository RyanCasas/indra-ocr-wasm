"""Right-to-left text for a recognizer that reads every line left to right.

A CTC recognizer emits characters in the order it sees them, left to right, so
the label of a line with Arabic or Hebrew is its characters in visual order.
``flip`` turns logical order (how text is stored and typed) into visual order,
and the same call turns visual order back into logical order:

- RTL base line (more RTL letters than LTR letters): the line reads right to
  left, so the order of its units reverses.  A unit is a run of LTR text
  (Latin words, digits, and the spaces and punctuation between them), which
  keeps its own order, or one other character cluster.
- LTR base line: the line keeps its order, and each run of RTL text reverses.

A cluster is a base character with its combining marks (Arabic harakat, Hebrew
niqqud), so marks stay after their base.  A mirrored character (brackets) at
right-to-left level changes to its mirror image, as a renderer draws it.

This is a small subset of the Unicode bidi algorithm (UAX #9): it has no
embeddings or isolates, and it resolves neutrals by runs.  It is its own
inverse, so the labels and the decoding always agree.
